# üìöBook Shopüìö
Welcome to the Online Bookstore API! This API provides essential
functionalities for managing books, user authentication,
and order processing, forming the backbone of a scalable and
efficient online bookstore. Inspired by the need for a
robust solution
in the digital book retail space, this project showcases
a fully functional online
bookstore built with Spring Boot. It includes features
like user registration, book browsing, shopping cart
management, and order processing, offering a solid foundation
for real-world applications.

## üõ†Ô∏èTechnologies and Toolsüõ†Ô∏è
### Backend:
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for the backend services.
- **Spring Boot**: A powerful framework for building production-ready applications quickly,
  providing features such as dependency injection, web frameworks, data access, and security.
- **Spring Security**: Used to handle authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access and management using Java Persistence Api.
- **Liquibase**: An open-source library for tracking, managing, and applying database schema changes.
### Database:
- **MySql**: A widely-used open-source relational database system, chosen for its reliability,
  ease of use, and support for complex queries and transactions.
### Testing:
- **JUnit**: A widely used testing framework for Java applications.
- **Mockito**: A mocking framework for unit test in Java.
- **Spring Boot Test**: Provide utilities for testing Spring Boot applications.
### CI/CD:
- **GitHub Actions**: Provides CI capabilities to automate building and testing the application.
### Containerization:
- **Docker**: Used to create, deploy, and run application in containers.
- **Docker Compose**: Used for defining and running multi-container Docker application.
### API Documentation:
- **Swagger/OpenApi**: Tools for generating and visualizing API documentation, making it easier to understand and use the API endpoints.
### Code Quality:
- **Checkstyle**: A development tool to help ensure that Java code adheres a coding standard.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool used primary for Java projects. It simplifies the build process and dependency management.
### Development Environment:
- **IntelliJIdea**: An integrated development environment for Java development.
- **Postman**: A tool for testing APIs by sending request and receiving response.
### Environment managing:
- **dotenv (.env)**: A module that loads environment variables from a '.env' file into the application, ensuring sensitive information is kept secure and not pushed to version control.
### Installation
1. **Clone github repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DmytroHadiuchko/Spring-BOOT.git

MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_password
MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT=3307
MYSQLDB_PORT=3306
DEBUG_PORT=5005
SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=8081
SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=8080
```
3. **Build the project**
```bash
./mvn clean package
```
4. **Run the Application**
  - **Using Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
